Sentinel-based Plasmodium falciparum molecular surveillance of artemisinin resistance mutations in Ethiopia

This repository holds all data and scripts needed to generate all figures and calculate prevalence for the manuscript entitled “Rising prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum artemisinin resistance mutations across Ethiopia”. This includes plots in the main text and in the supplemental material for this manuscript. Additional software packages and tools that are useful when working with MIP data are available at https://github.com/bailey-lab/MIPTools and https://github.com/Mrc-ide/mipanalyzer. Code to calculate complexity of infection and population allele frequencies using SNP available at https://github.com/OJWatson/McCOILR.
